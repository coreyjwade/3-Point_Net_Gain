    "There has never been a single metric to determine the best NBA 3-Point shooters. Most fans know the reality from watching the games. Objectively, most fans consider two numbers, 3-point Percentage, and 3 Pointers Made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there an empirical way to combine 3-point Percentage and 3-pointers Made into one metric? Will the metric verify that Steph Curry is the greatest 3-point shooter of all-time? What about the best 3-point shooting team of all-time?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, I have developed 3-point Average, or 3Pave. This metric computes the number of points the team gains per possession when the player makes a 3-pointer, minus the number of points the team loses when the player misses a 3-pointer. This metric is evaluated based on the expected value of points on an average possession.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains Exploratory Data Analysis regarding to the new metric, 3Pave. It evaluates 3-point shooters throughout NBA History using 3Pave, and another new metric, Expected Minutes before a 3, or EM3. Data Wrangling steps are included for those with an interest in learning pandas. Readers uninterested in pandas can skip directly to [New NBA Stats](#New-NBA-Stats).    \n",

    "Three new NBA statistics have been presented. EM3A, Expected Minutes before a 3-point Attempt could be of value to coaches preparing for opponents and working with their own players. EM3, Expected Minutes before a 3, is a fun statistic that could be used for similar reasons. 3Pave, 3-point Average, is a powerful statistic that provides a single number to rank 3-point shooters across all seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Pave rewards players for making 3-point shots, and penalizes them for missing. Players that make a lot of 3s, but shoot a low percentage are exposed as making slight contributions to their teams. Players who shoot a high percentage need to make a high volume to be competitive. 3Pave rankings are statisically verifiable while simultaneously communicating valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Pave reveals the gain in points beyond the league average that a player adds to his team by shooting 3's. It can be weighted, summed, or displayed as per game averages. It can be used as a barometer to determine whether a player should be encouraged or discouraged from shooting 3's. Any positive score is a plus for the team, while negative scores are a detriment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Pave stands up well to general expectations. With the analysis above, one can argue that Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kyle Korver are the best 3-point shooters of all-time, with Ray Allen close behind. The Golden State Warriors are verifiably the greatest 3-point shooting team of all time, followed by the 7-seconds-or-less Phoenix Suns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Pave can be used to analyze playoff statistics and clutch 3-point shooters. It can be used during basketball seasons past and future to analyze the success of 3-point shooters. It can be used for any league, WNBA, college, high school, etc., provided that an appropiate expected value, like points per possession, is utilized."
